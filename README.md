# aplos

A node experiment.

I'm not satisfied with how to setup an API server in node.

There are solutions out there (loopback, restify, hapi).
But none of them feel natural and simple to use. (to me at least)

Aplos is not a real piece of code, it's an experiment.
The goal is to write an API server the way I would have liked to write it.
Without language or framework limitations.

Instead of writing a library or framework and find a use for it.
I decided to reverse the thinking.
I will first code the API server as I feel it. Then I will gradually
implement/polyfill the missing pieces.

**The code is not meant to be run in the first place.**

Aplos is a living experiment and could lay the foundations to an hypothetical
node API framework.

I will use all the latest JS tech (es7)
I will try to structure the project so it's easy to pick up even for newbies
